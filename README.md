# IMDb Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to our IMDb Data Analysis project! We delved into IMDb’s extensive datasets to uncover intriguing insights about movies and TV shows. Our work focused on transforming raw data into a usable format, cleaning up inconsistencies, and conducting exploratory analysis.

### What We Did

- **Data Wrangling**: We organized the raw tab-separated values (TSV) files, converting them into a structured format for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: We addressed missing values and inconsistencies to ensure our findings were based on accurate data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We examined patterns in movie ratings, explored popular genres, and analyzed the profiles of notable actors.
- **Basic Data Analysis**

Our goal was to make sense of IMDb’s rich dataset and uncover trends that offer a fresh perspective on the entertainment industry.
